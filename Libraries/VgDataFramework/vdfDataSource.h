/// This class serves as a base class for data source nodes. Unlike most data
/// nodes, data source nodes often do not directly provide data which can be
/// visualized in a scene. Rather, data source nodes provide low level "raw"
/// data that is meant to be received by suitable aggregator nodes, which
/// collect and organize this data for presentation. As such, data notes
/// usually cannot be updated.
///
/// This raw data is provided via one or more source interfaces, which define
/// signals through which the data is supplied. Applications typically create
/// aggregator nodes for those data types supported by the application, which
/// are connected to compatible interfaces provided by a data source node when
/// a new data source node becomes available.

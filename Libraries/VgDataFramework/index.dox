\mainpage VisGUI Data Framework Documentation

The VisGUI Data Framework (VDF) provides a framework for managing large and
heterogeneous data sets in a hierarchical manner.

Global data sets may consist of several logical data groupings (e.g. videos
with associated tracks and events) as well as additional loosely-related data
(e.g. cartographic imagery providers). Using a tree to represent related data
is convenient and sensible. Using a generic base node class, along with a root
node, allows users to maintain a single structure containing all of the above
mentioned data elements.

VDF uses QObject as an ancestor class for nodes. This provides a number of conveniences, such as the ability for nodes to respond to events, notification
of node destruction via the QObject::destroyed() signal, automatic reaping of
child nodes on destruction of the parent, and tracking of node relationships
using QObject's parenting.

The base node class, vdfNodeBase, also provides some common functionality, such
as the ability for the user to supply a meaningful name to a node, and to
globally toggle visibility of associated data in all active views. Additional
functionality not visible to end users includes reference counting of views
that are using a node, allowing derived node classes to create and destroy
resources on demand in order to conserve resources, and improved notification
of child creation.

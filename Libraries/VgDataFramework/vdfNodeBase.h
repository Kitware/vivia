/// Base class for data tree nodes.
///
/// This class defines the minimum interface implemented by a node in a VisGUI
/// data tree. Concrete data nodes implement interfaces to provide data for
/// visualization, or to enable interaction with the node. Typically, a scene
/// tree is constructed by walking a data tree, querying each node for
/// supported interfaces, and building representations based on what interfaces
/// each node implements.
///
/// Not every node will implement usable interfaces. The root node in
/// particular is often actually a vdfNodeBase (i.e. not a subclass thereof).
///
/// Management of the node tree is handled by QObject. Consumers should be
/// careful to allow for their associated data nodes to be destroyed at any
/// time.

  /// display name.
  ///
  /// One reason to hide nodes is used by dynamic data nodes which must be
  /// created to handle types of data which may be received by sources,
  /// allowing them to 'lurk' until and unless such a source is actually

/// Generic item context menu.
///
/// This class provides a common context menu and shortcut actions for item
/// views. When associated with an item model and connected to the selection
/// signals for the same, it provides automatic enabling and disabling of
/// actions, as appropriate. Some actions (e.g. note editing) also provide
/// function implementations as well. The menu emits signals to notify the
/// application when action should be taken to update item information (e.g.
/// item note, visibility state, etc.) or to perform other actions requested by
/// the user (e.g. jump to item).
///
/// Users may add the common actions to their own context (i.e. by calling
/// actions() on the context menu instance and QWidget::addAction() to copy the
/// actions into their own context) in order to allow the user to activate the
/// actions by their shortcut key sequences without the need to open the menu.
/// The provided common actions use Qt::WidgetWithChildrenShortcut as their
/// shortcut context, so that different views may each use their own instance
/// of the actions to operate on their own selections without conflicting with
/// other views that may have different item selections.
///
/// Because it is a subclass of QMenu, users are free to add their own actions
/// in addition to the common set that is provided.

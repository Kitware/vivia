Vision Visualization and Analysis

--------------------------------------------

ViViA is an open source C++/Qt project for visualizing video analytics.  It consists
of applications designed to allow a user to intereact with surveillance video from a
variety of surveillance video sources (Full Motion Video, Wide Area Motion Imagery etc.)
The ViViA applications provide User Interfaces for reviewing the results of automated analysis
of such videos.  These results might include the tracks of moving fishs or scallops or
the results analyzing the behavior of such tracks.

ViViA is provided as part of [Kitware's](http://www.kitware.com) [KWIVER Toolkit](http://www.kwiver.org).

For the present, this repository is provided for informational and references purposes only.  In the
coming months, Kitware will be updating this repository with build instructions, example code and other
documentation.  Please subscribe to this repository on Github so that you'll be sure to find out about
